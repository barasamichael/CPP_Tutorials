# The Standard Template Library
## Preamble
The C++ standard library leverages templates to provide a rich collection of 
standard generic containers and algorithms to manipulate the containers and 
process the elements they contain.

## Major STL Components (4)
1. **Generic(templated) containers** for storing data, such as _std::vector_
2. **Iterators** for traversing containers
3. **Algorithms** for processing the data within containers
4. **Miscallenous utility classes and functions**, such as _std::swap_ and 
	_std::max_

The design of the containers and their operators make the STL's generic 
algorithms possible. Richard Halterman describes them as: powerful and 
flexible but somewhat arcane and difficult for casual C++ programmers.
